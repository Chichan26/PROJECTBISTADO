      <h3>Republic Act No. 3019 Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</h3>
      <p>Republic Act 3019, also known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, clearly defines the different acts of corruption and misconduct that public officials can commit, such as bribery, misuse of government resources, and giving unfair advantage to private individuals.</p>
      <p>It exists to protect government funds, ensure fairness in public transactions, and prevent any official from using their position for personal gain.</p>
      <p>By enforcing strict penalties like imprisonment, confiscation of illegal wealth, and disqualification from office, the law aims to maintain integrity, restore public trust, and strengthen accountability within the government.</p>

      <h3>Article XI Accountability of Public Officers</h3>
      <p>Article XI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution establishes the principle that public office is a public trust, meaning all government officials must serve with responsibility, integrity, loyalty, efficiency, and respect for the people they represent.</p>
      <p>It empowers oversight institutions such as the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan to investigate, discipline, suspend, or remove public officers who violate ethical standards or misuse their authority.</p>
      <p>Through these mechanisms, Article XI strengthens the protection of citizens' rights, promotes clean governance, and ensures that officials remain answerable for their actions.</p>

      <h3>Republic Act No. 6713 Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards</h3>
      <p>Republic Act 6713 outlines ethical principles that guide the behavior of public officials, including commitment to public service, professionalism, simple living, and transparency in all dealings.</p>
      <p>It requires government workers to act fairly, avoid conflicts of interest, respond to public needs promptly, and remain politically neutral while serving the community.</p>
      <p>By enforcing the annual filing of SALN and requiring openness in all official transactions, RA 6713 seeks to build a culture of accountability, honesty, and trust between the government and the Filipino people.</p>
